# Approach, models and assumption.


## modeling assumption
- Reduce to demo/rep
- Add history fo past--> Compare models with/without
- Boosintg, ...., ---> SOme= accurate]

## Look for understanding 
- Predcition is important but further 
- Extremeley close points. Non-identifibality
- 'Political noise' - variance over time negligeable -> Picture Noise. + HIsti+STD per district. 
Less noisiness. 

- Urges us to put into practice those
- Dimensionality reduction
- Logitsi regression woth Lasso--> *Bootsrap, smot to takcle the pb of feat. importance.

Our baseline model is a logistic regression that predicts the results of each district. This model takes in input some social-economic predictors with general political information. We have trained this model in the results of the House of States elections from 2010 to 2016 and we tested this model on the 2018 elections.
