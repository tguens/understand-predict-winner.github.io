Several experiments with the goal to predict the elections' outcomes. For instance, in [7](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6113109), the author analyzes methods of prediction using sentiment analysis from social network data (notaby tweets, and google search results). They reached to the conclusion that these technics are not sufficient to predict elections. 

The article [1](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/democrats-eye-house-takeover-to-challengetrump-as-gop-tries-to-hang-on/2018/11/06/2c4ff3a0-e200-11e8-8f5fa55347f48762_story.html) from *The Washington Post* presents the electoral vote within different subgroups: age, sex, race, education sub-categories or even and among rural or city environments. The conclusion reached, id est - within catgeories, the vote was significantly different - strengthened our prior belief that understanding what are the most influential features is key to our problem and urged us to collect more socio-economic data.

The research conducted in [8](https://github.com/tguens/understand-predict-winner.github.io/blob/master/references.md) explores why the party controlling the presidency suffers from an electoral decline when come the midterms elections. Their are looking for explanation compatible with historical records. According to their conclusions, no factor except a presidential penality is statistically relevant. 

The publication [9] (https://github.com/tguens/understand-predict-winner.github.io/blob/master/references.md) proposes a Bayesian model for the prediction of the United States Presidential elections. Their model is simple, they combine polls at a state levels and suppose that the latter are normally distributed around the result of the elections. With a prior belief and polls observations, they can estimate the posterior distribution of the results. The authors claim that their methods is effective to handle swing states. Our Bayesian model on polls is similar to theirs but we took into account the date when the polls where conducted.
