Many statistical studies have been made to predict the outcomes of elections. A few of them catched our attention. In [7](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6113109), the author analyzes methods of prediction using sentiment analyzes with information on social network. They collected data on both Twitter and Google. They reach to the conclusion that these technics are not sufficient to predict elections. 

The article [1] from *The Washington Post* presents how group of people voted during the 2018 midterm elections. A quick conclusion of this article is that vote differ through age, sex, race, education and among rural or city environments. Hence, it strenghtened our belief to collect socio-economic data because they impact vote.

The research paper [8] explores why the party controlling the presidency suffer an electoral decline at the midterms elections. Their are looking for explanation compatible with historical records. According to their conclusions, no factor except a presidential penality is statistically relevant. 

The publication [9] proposes a Bayesian model for the prediction of the United States Presidential elections. Their model is simple, they combine polls at a state levels and suppose that the latter are normally distributed around the result of the elections. With a prior belief and polls observations, they can estimate the posterior distribution of the results. The authors claim that their methods is effective to handle swing states. Our Bayesian model on polls is similar to theirs but we took into account the date when the polls where conducted.
